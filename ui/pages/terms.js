              Welcome to Pernamint, owned and operated by Decentralized, Inc
              ("Decentralized," "WE," "US" OR "OUR") WEBSITE
              (<a href="https://pernamint.com/" target="_blank">https://www.pernamint.com</a>), ("SITE"). THIS AGREEMENT GOVERNS YOUR
              ACCESS AND USE OF THE SITE.<br></br>
              <br></br>
              This site also allows you to sell and purchase Crypto Assets
              (defined in Section 1) via auction ("Auction"). Detailed rules
              regarding the Auction process are available on this page, Auction
              Rules. You may only participate in the Auction by linking your
              digital wallets on MetaMask (<a href="https://metamask.io/">https://metamask.io/</a>). <br></br>
              MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase,
              store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency.
              Before putting up your Unique Digital Asset for Auction or putting
              in an offer to purchase a Unique Digital Asset from another user,
              we will ask you to download the MetaMask extension, and connect
              and unlock your digital wallets with MetaMask. Once you submit an
              order to sell or purchase a Unique Digital Asset, your order is
              passed on to MetaMask and MetaMask completes the transaction on
              your behalf. <br></br>
              ALL TRANSACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH OUR SITE ARE FACILITATED AND
              RUN BY METAMASK AND BY USING OUR SERVICES YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE
              GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE (<a href="https://metamask.io/terms.html" target="_blank">https://metamask.io/terms.html</a>)

              PERNAMINT IS A PLATFORM. WE ARE NOT A BROKER, FINANCIAL

                    sole discretion: infringes intellectual property rights;

                    Third-Party Content Complaints. If you believe that someone
                    has posted User Materials that violates this policy (other
                    than in cases of copyright infringement, which is addressed
                    separately below), we ask you to promptly notify us by email
                    at the following address: [email address]. You must use this
                    address if you want to ensure that your complaint is
                    actually received by the appropriate person charged with
                    investigating alleged policy violations. In order to allow
                    us to respond effectively, please provide us with as much
                    detail as possible, including: (1) the nature of the right
                    infringed or violated (including the registration numbers of
                    any registered trademarks or patents allegedly infringed);
                    (2) all facts which lead you to believe that a right has
                    been violated or infringed; (3) the precise location where
                    the offending User Materials can be found; (4) any grounds
                    to believe that the person who posted the User Materials was
                    not authorized to do so or did not have a valid defense
                    (including the defense of fair use); and (5) if known, the
                    identity of the person or persons who posted the infringing
                    or offending User Materials. By lodging a complaint, you

                    to constitute a representation made under penalty of perjury
                    under the laws of the State of Delaware. In addition, you
                    agree, at your own expense, to defend and indemnify us and
                    hold us harmless against all claims which may be asserted
                    against us, and all losses incurred, as a result of your

                    any and all claims or remedies that you might otherwise be

                    (including, without limitation, intellectual property laws)

                    notice, we will remove or disable access to allegedly
                    infringing material. There are substantial penalties for
                    false claims (see 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) - providing sanctions

                    against you, you may submit a counter-notification to our
                    DMCA Agent. Specific requirements for a proper
                    counter-notification are set forth in the DMCA (see 17
                    U.S.C. § 512(g)(3)). A valid counter-notification must be a
                    written communication that includes all of the following

                    materially and adversely affect the Crypto Assets, which may
                    also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot
                    guarantee that any purchasers of Crypto Assets will not lose
                    money.

                    Our Site does not store, send, or receive Crypto Assets.
                    This is because Crypto Assets exist only by virtue of the
                    ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain.
                    Any transfer of Crypto Assets occurs within the supporting
                    blockchain and not on this Site.

                    of the Site, to any products sold or distributed through the
                    Site, or to any aspect of your relationship with Pernamint

                    court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims
                    court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or Pernamint may

                    Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act
                    governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
                    Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding,
                    you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing
                    your claim to our registered agent [include name and address
                    of registered agent here]. The arbitration will be conducted
                    by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution
                    provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under
                    $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest,
                    shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the
                    Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at
                    <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all
                    other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version
                    of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures,
                    available at
                    <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>.
                    JAMS’s rules are also available at jamsadr.com or by calling
                    JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate,
                    the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If
                    the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s
                    filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot
                    obtain a waiver from JAMS, Pernamint will pay them for you.
                    In addition, Pernamint will reimburse all such JAMS’s
                    filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims
                    totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines
                    the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the
                    arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
                    submissions, or in person in the country where you live or
                    at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the
                    award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
                    of competent jurisdiction.

                  <li>
                    Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive
                    authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of
                    this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute
                    related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability
                    or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but
                    not limited to any claim that all or any part of this
                    Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration
                    will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and
                    Pernamint. The arbitration proceeding will not be
                    consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
                    cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
                    grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The
                    arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary
                    damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
                    available to an individual under applicable law, the
                    arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the
                    Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written
                    award and statement of decision describing the essential
                    findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
                    including the calculation of any damages awarded. The
                    arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an
                    individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
                    The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you
                    and us.

                    Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND MAKERSPLACE HEREBY WAIVE ANY
                    CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE
                    A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Pernamint are
                    instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be
                    resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement,
                    except as specified in Section 15.1 above. An arbitrator can
                    award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as
                    a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.
                    However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court
                    review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited
                    review.

                    AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT

                    CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER
                    CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that
                    applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of this
                    subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief,
                    then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and
                    brought in the state or federal courts located in the State
                    of Delaware. All other claims shall be arbitrated.

                    written notice of your decision to opt out to the following

                    statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration
                    Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all
                    other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.
                    Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on

                    the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific
                    part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be
